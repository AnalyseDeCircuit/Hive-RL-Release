## 🔬 Technical Principles

### Reinforcement Learning Framework

- **State Space**: 820-dimensional vector containing board state, hand information, game progress
- **Action Space**: 20,000 discrete actions covering all possible placements and moves
- **Reward System**: Multi-layer reward design from basic survival to advanced strategies

### Reward Shaping System

```python
Terminal Rewards (Weight: 60-63%)
├── Victory: +5.0 + speed bonus
├── Defeat: -6.0 (queen surrounded)
├── Timeout: -3.0 (delay penalty)
└── Draw: Fine-tuned by advantage

Strategic Rewards (Weight: 25-40%)
├── Surrounding Progress: Progressive rewards
├── Defense Improvement: Safe position rewards  
└── Piece Coordination: Position value assessment

Basic Rewards (Weight: 5-15%)
├── Survival Reward: Tiny positive values
└── Action Reward: Legal action encouragement
```

### Neural Network Architecture

- **Input Layer**: 820-dimensional state vector
- **Hidden Layers**: Multi-layer fully connected with ReLU activation
- **Output Layer**: 20,000-dimensional Q-value prediction
- **Optimizer**: Adam with dynamic learning rate
- **Regularization**: Dropout, gradient clipping

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Training Efficiency

- **Parallel Speed**: >1000 episodes/hour
- **Convergence Time**: 3-4 hours for curriculum completion
- **Sample Efficiency**: Expert level reached in 120k episodes

### AI Capabilities

- **Policy Consistency**: >95% decision reproduction rate for same positions
- **Robustness**: Maintains high performance under adversarial perturbations

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Custom Rewards

```python
# Create custom reward shaper
from improved_reward_shaping import HiveRewardShaper

shaper = HiveRewardShaper('custom')
shaper.config['terminal_weight'] = 0.7  # Increase terminal reward weight
shaper.config['strategy_weight'] = 0.3  # Adjust strategy reward weight
```

### Training Parameter Tuning

```python
# Adjust hyperparameters in ai_trainer.py
batch_size = 32          # Batch size
learning_rate = 0.001    # Learning rate  
epsilon_start = 0.9      # Initial exploration rate
epsilon_end = 0.05       # Final exploration rate
discount_factor = 0.95   # Discount factor
```

### Parallel Configuration

```python
# Adjust parallel worker count
num_workers = 10         # Adjust based on CPU cores
episodes_per_worker = 100 # Episodes per worker
queue_maxsize = 100      # Queue size
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Slow Training Speed**
   - Check parallel worker configuration
   - Ensure queue is not blocked
   - Verify reward_shaper is correctly passed

2. **Abnormal AI Behavior**
   - Check reward system configuration
   - Verify endgame statistics are reasonable
   - Analyze epsilon decay curve

3. **Memory Issues**
   - Reduce batch_size
   - Adjust experience replay buffer size
   - Use fewer parallel workers

### Debug Tools

# Analyze latest training model
python analyze_model.py

# Visualize training curves
